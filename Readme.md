# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge! üöÄ  
This repository contains all my code, projects, and tutorials related to my daily Python journey. Each day, I‚Äôll be tackling different Python concepts, working on small projects, and learning new techniques. Follow along as I aim to become a better Python developer over the next 100 days! üíªüêç

## About

The goal of this project is to spend **100 days** coding and improving my Python skills by completing daily challenges, building mini-projects, and learning new concepts. The purpose of this repo is to showcase my progress and help others who are on a similar coding journey. Each day, I'll add new files, notes, and challenges to track my learning.

## How to Follow Along

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theDevanshShah/100_Days_Of_Code.git
    ```

2. **Check the "daily" folders** to follow along with the code:
    - Each day‚Äôs challenge will be stored as a Python file (e.g., `day-1.py`).
    - At the end of each day, I‚Äôll reflect on my learning in the corresponding `README.md` for that day.
    
3. **Fork and contribute**: Feel free to fork this repo and contribute your solutions or improvements. If you have any suggestions, open an issue or pull request!

## Daily Logs

Here, I‚Äôll be documenting my daily coding progress. Each day will have its own sub-folder with a Python file and additional resources (if applicable).

- **Day 0**: [Intro & Setup](README.md)
- **Day 1**: [Intro to Python & Variables](day-1/README.md)

Check out each day's folder for the Python code, challenges, and notes!
