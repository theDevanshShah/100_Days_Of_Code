# Day 1: Variables and Data Types
# Today we'll learn about storing and using data in Python

# Variables are like containers that store data
name = "Alice"  # This is a string (text)
age = 25        # This is an integer (whole number)
height = 5.6    # This is a float (decimal number)
is_student = True  # This is a boolean (True/False)

# Let's print our variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is student:", is_student)

# We can change variable values
age = 26
print("Updated age:", age)

# Different data types have different operations
# Strings can be concatenated (joined together)
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Full name:", full_name)

# Numbers can be used in calculations
x = 10
y = 5
print("x + y =", x + y)
print("x - y =", x - y)
print("x * y =", x * y)
print("x / y =", x / y)

# We can convert between data types
number_string = "42"
number_int = int(number_string)  # Convert string to integer
print("String:", number_string, "Integer:", number_int)

# Challenge: Create your own variables and try different operations!
