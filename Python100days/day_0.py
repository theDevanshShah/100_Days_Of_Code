# Day 0: Introduction to Python
# Welcome to your Python learning journey!

# This is a comment - it doesn't execute, just explains the code
print("Hello, World!")  # This is the traditional first program

# Let's learn about different types of print statements
print("Welcome to Python Programming!")
print("Today we're learning the basics")

# We can print multiple things on the same line
print("Python", "is", "awesome!")

# We can also use different quote types
print('Single quotes work too')
print("Double quotes are also fine")

# Let's try some basic math
print("2 + 2 =", 2 + 2)
print("10 - 5 =", 10 - 5)
print("3 * 4 =", 3 * 4)
print("15 / 3 =", 15 / 3)

# Challenge: Try changing the numbers above and see what happens!
