# Python Operators â€” Day 2

This short lesson explains the main operator categories in Python with examples. Use `operators.py` for runnable examples and `test_operators.py` for quick checks.

Sections
- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Bitwise operators
- Membership and identity
- Operator precedence and examples

See `operators.py` for concise functions you can run or import.

Quick reference
- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, // (floor), % (mod), ** (power)
- Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=
- Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical: and, or, not
- Bitwise: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
- Membership: in, not in
- Identity: is, is not

Notes
- Use parentheses to make precedence explicit when needed.
- Division `/` returns float; use `//` for integer (floor) division.
